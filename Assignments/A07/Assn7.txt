Watch the attached video, Evolving a language in and for the real world (C++ 1991-2006).mov, and answer the questions.

1. Complete the following find function in C++.

template<class Iter, class T>
Iter find(Iter first, Iter last, const T& val) {
	while(first != last){
		if(*first==val) return first;
		first++;
	}
	return last;
}

2. Why did C++ succeed?

	The language has a direct interface to other languages especially with C.
	Its aim was to be more correct, maintainable, efficient, and portable.
	It is Object-oriented programming, with generic programming, generic programming,
	Resource management, and error handling.  It was able to represent ideas directly
	with code.  It represent independent ideas independently to code.  It offers a 
	hierachical structure.  And more importantly, it is better than C.
